# guess-number-game
This Python game lets you guess a number chosen by the computer within a user-defined range. After entering the range, the computer picks a random number. You get 7 chances to guess it, with hints if your guess is too high or low. If you guess it right, you win; otherwise, the correct number is revealed after 7 tries.
